# this policy denies any egress from backend/backend-app
# however hello_world_netpol.yaml allows ingress to hello-world/workload-a from all pods in backend
# still, in the results we see that there is no connection between backend/backend-app but hello-world/workload-a
# is exposed to all pods in backend namespace, because its policy accepts that;
# and our goal is to emphasize cases where the policy better be tightened (hello_world_netpol in this case)
