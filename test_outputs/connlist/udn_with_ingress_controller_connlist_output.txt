Permitted connectivity analyzed in Pod network:
all input workloads are configured with (C)UDN as their primary network interface

Permitted connectivity analyzed in primary UDN green:
0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255[External] => green[udn]/app[Pod] : All Connections
green[udn]/app[Pod] => 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255[External] : All Connections
{ingress-controller} => green[udn]/app[Pod] : TCP 8000,8090

Workload-to-Networks Mapping:
green/app[Pod]: green[UDN]
